To run the server, please first go to ***./webserver*** folder and then run:
***python simply.py***

Before the webserver can be accessed, the inverted index must be created, which might take some time (less than a minute).
Therefore, after running the above command, please wait for the inverted index to complete before proceeding.

Once the webserver goes up, it will be accessible by opening your browser and go to: 
***localhost:8080***
